1. How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A: It helped by providing the list of changes that were carried between the two files along with the details of the changes.

2. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: It will help in moving things to & fro trying to synchronise file for the final result.

3. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

A: Pros: Flexibility to the programmer. 
   Con: Manual effort

4.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A: Git is suitable for programming, which does involve multiple files. Others like Google docs are general purpose file storage options.

5. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A: Git log to check history of all changes & git diff to check detailed differences in code between any two versions.

6. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A: I can revert back to the set of files without losing the existing files.

7. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A: Not sure. Im yet to learn more.
