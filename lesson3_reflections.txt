1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Branches are addition of files to an existing files, as possible future implementations, without disturbing the present files. 

Fork will be used to get repository from another user on github and work on the code.Cloning will be used to get those files from github to the local system for making necessary modifications. Branching will be used to make possible add-ons and features, with out effecting the master branch of the git.

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: It helps is comparing the changes in code done by lets say a collaborator for example and choose the best change to resolve the conflicts, if any.
